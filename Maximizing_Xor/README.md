Maximizing XOR
==============
Given two integers: L and R,

find the maximal values of A xor B given, L ≤ A ≤ B ≤ R

###Input Format###
The input contains two lines, L is present in the first line. 
R in the second line.

###Constraints###

```
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ 103
```

###Output Format###
The maximal value as mentioned in the problem statement.

###Sample Input###

```
1
10
```

###Sample Output###

```
15
```

###Explanation###

The maximum value can be obtained for A = 5 and B = 10,

1010 xor 0101 = 1111 hence 15.
